Thank you to the TAs who helped us throughout this assignment.

_______________________________________________________________________________

The assignment and all features of the um have been implemented to the best of
our abilities.

_______________________________________________________________________________

Design Changes:

- The I/O module no longer directly reads and then passes the bitpacked 
  instructions to the unpack module. Rather, instructions are first stored in
  the segments module before being unpacked.

- The Addresses module is no longer represented by a Hanson Sequence, but
  rather by a Hanson Stack, as it is unnecessary to ask for an address at a
  specific index. We only need to be able to get an unused identifier if one
  exists.

- The Addresses module is used to store identifiers, not memory addresses.

- The addition instruction no longer mods the sum by 2^32. Doing so
  unintentionally reduces the range of possible sums by 1, and is unnecessary
  due to integer overflow.

- The multiplication instruction no longer mods the product by 2^32. Doing so
  unintentionally reduces the range of possible products by 1, and is
  unnecessary due to integer overflow.

- Load program is now stored in the Instructions (Arithmetic and Data) module,
  rather than in its own module.

- Halt no longer "resets" computation, but rather stops it entirely.

Modules:

Addresses
    Addresses is implemented with a Hanson Stack to represent a data structure
    that outputs the last value that was inputted. It knows whether or not
    there are available IDs to reuse, and what the next possible ID is.

Bookend
    Bookend is a wrapper for the um's "constructor" and "deconstructor," which
    allocate and free memory, as well as instantiate the um's initial
    0-segment. It also holds the halt instruction, which is simply the
    deconstructor with an additional command that halts execution. It interacts
    with the Addresses, Registers, Segments, and Unpack modules.

Bounds Check
    Bounds Check is a wrapper for a simple bounds checking function, which
    simply checks whether or not a given integer can be represented by the
    given number of bits. It interacts with the provided Bitpacking module.

Handle
    Handle is a set of two functions which handle passing the given parameters
    to each of the 14 um instructions. It is split up into a general
    instructions function and a loadvalue function. The general instructions
    function uses a switch statement and identifies instructions by their
    opcode. It interacts with the various instructions modules.

Instructions (Arithmetic and Data)
    Instructions (Arithmetic and Data) is a wrapper for the arithmetic
    instructions and data instructions, or addition, multiplication, division,
    conditional move, and load value. It interacts with the Bounds Check and
    Registers modules.

Instructions (I/O)
    Instructions (Arithmetic and Data) is a wrapper for the I/O instructions,
    or input and output. It interacts with the Bounds Check, I/O, and Registers
    modules.

Instructions (Logical)
    Instructions (Logical) is a wrapper for the logical instruction, or bitwise
    NAND. It interacts with the Registers modules.

Instructions (Memory)
    Instructions (Logical) is a wrapper for the memory instructions, or map
    segment, unmap segment, segmented load, segmented store, and load program.
    It interacts with the Registers, Segments, and Unpack modules.

All of the instructions modules are essentially used to pass parameters from
the Handle module to the Registers and Segments modules. While these modules
interact with many other modules, they do not care about the values each of the
other modules hold.

I/O
    I/O is a wrapper for various input/output functions, or open file, close
    file, read line, read char, and write char.

Main
    The main module uses the I/O and Bookend modules to start and end the UM
    gracefully, and the Unpack module to execute the UM.

Registers
    Registers is implemented with a C Array of 32-bit words, or uint32_t
    values. This module holds the values kept in the registers and interacts
    with the Bounds Check module.

Segments
    Segments is implemented with a one-dimensional Hanson Sequence. Each index
    number in the Sequence corresponds with an address. The segments themselves
    are malloc'd space for uint32_t values. The word length of the segments is
    held in another one-dimensional Hanson Sequence with corresponding indices.
    When segments are unmapped, they are free'd and set to NULL. The 0-segment
    is instantiated dissimilarly from other segments by the "constructor" in
    the Bookend module. The Segments module holds the values kept in the
    segments and the segments themselves. It interacts with the I/O module to
    populate the 0-segment.

Unpack
    Unpack unpacks and executes the instructions held in the 0-segment, passing
    them to the Handle module. It holds the program counter. It interacts with
    the Handle and Segments modules, and the provided Bitpacking module.

_______________________________________________________________________________

time ./um sandmark.umz
2,000,000,000+ instructions
      ~ 185.3  seconds

time ./um midmark.umz
   80,000,000+ instructions
      ~   7.2  seconds

   50,000,000  instructions
      ~   4.5  seconds (estimate)

Executing a single instruction seems to take an average of 0.00000009 seconds.
